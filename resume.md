Monsoon discussion forums are organized in IITM every year during the boreal summer to discuss various aspects of the monsoon. I have been consistently involved in providing the seasonal outlooks at this forum (2015-present).
Due to COVID some of these talks were online, benefitting audience outside of IITM. Some of these talks are available from the [IITM YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@iitmpune6704).
