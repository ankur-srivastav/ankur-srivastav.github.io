About me

I am a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, and I am an oceanographer, meteorologist, and engineer. I earned my Ph.D. in Climate Studies from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My research interests include Monsoons, their different modes of variability, Monsoon teleconnections, Predictability, Coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, and Seasonal Prediction. During my Ph.D., I worked on the impact of rivers on the monsoon. Additionally, I am interested in High-Performance Computing and Big Data. Interested in collaborating on a common research problem? Please drop me an email.
